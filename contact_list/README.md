# Contact List

---

## Problem

Byron had an idea to build a user friendly contacts list application that was web based. Since he wasn't a developer, he hired a friend to build it for him. His friend figured that building a single page application was the best way to achieve Byron's goal, so he started by building a back end. After building the back end, he got too busy with his day job and could no longer work on the project. Byron has approached you to take over the project.

## Requirements

- Byron wants to be able to create, edit, and delete categories
- Byron wants to be able to create, edit, and delete contacts
- He would like to be able to organize his contacts by category
- In addition to working well, Byron is really concerned with his application looking nice
- Byron really liked what he heard from his friend about single page applications and wants you to continue in that vein
- When adding new contacts, Byron wants them to nicely fade in.
- Finally, he wants a button to an `About` 'page' that has some information about you, since you are developing the application.

## Tips

Your grandmother has recently discovered an NPR podcast about web development. She is really enjoying learning more about what you do and has even started offering helpful advice.

- "That Byron sounds like a nice fellow, you should make sure his application looks really nice! Last weeks episode mentioned [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) and [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com) which are supposed to be something called a CSS Framework or some such".
- "Ooooh, fading. Isn't that called [animations or whatnot](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)?"

## Bonus Features

- Use [Draggabilly](http://draggabilly.desandro.com) to drag and drop contacts into different categories. This should also update the database so they are now apart of the category they have been dragged to.
- Add a smart search feature that filters on keydown. Go to [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com) and use their search feature and pay attention to exactly how it works.
- Use [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) for complex iteration and enumeration.
- Add a map button to each contact. Clicking it will pop up a modal that uses the [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to show a map with that contact's location pinned.
- Use [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) to show a graph of the top 3 cities your contacts are from.
- Make the application responsive so that it is viewable on a mobile phone.
